<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>GNUSim8085 was originally written by Sridhar Ratnakumar in year 2003 when he realized that no proper simulators existed for Linux. Since then it has been improved with features/fixes and ported to Windows thanks to help of various minds that are inclined to share knowledge.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>GNUSim8085 makes it easy to learn the assembly language programming by providing an easy to use user interface. The application currently has following features.</p>

<ul>
<li>Program editor with interactive input wizard for the standard instructions</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting in editor to distinguish between instructions, operands, comments etc.</li>
<li>Support for standard instructions of the 8085</li>
<li>Support for popular assembler directives</li>
<li>Complete view of registers and flags</li>
<li>Programming debugging using breakpoints or with step by step execution</li>
<li>Easy inspection of stack and source code variables defined</li>
<li>Easy inspection and manipulation of memory and I/O ports</li>
<li>Printing of program from editor as well as assembled hex code</li>
</ul>


<h2>User Interface</h2>

<p>The user interface of GNUSim8085 consists of following components currently.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Program Editor</p>

<p><img src="editor.png" alt="Editor" /><br/>
User can create new or edit existing program in editor. The editor has syntax highlighting to distinguish between between instructions, operands, comments etc. The ‘Load me at’ input allows specifying the start address of the assembled program.</p></li>
<li><p>Assembler Messages</p>

<p><img src="assembler_messages.png" alt="Assembler Messages" /><br/>
When program is assembled the status or any error messages are displayed in this section. When user clicks on any error message the editor highlights corresponding line.</p></li>
<li><p>Registers and Flags</p>

<p><img src="registers_flag.png" alt="Registers and Flags" /><br/>
Values in various registers are displayed here. Also the status of flags such as carry flag is displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>Data conversion and access</p>

<p><img src="io.png" alt="Data Conversion" /><br/>
User can easily convert data between decimal and hexadecimal format. The I/O ports and memory contents can be accessed by specifying the address. To update the contents enter new value and click appropriate update button.</p></li>
<li><p>Data details</p>

<p><img src="tab_data.png" alt="Tab Data" /><br/>
This tab lets you inspect values of various variables defined in the program.</p></li>
<li><p>Stack details</p>

<p><img src="tab_stack.png" alt="Tab Stack" /><br/>
This tab lets you inspect values at various stack locations.</p></li>
<li><p>Keypad</p>

<p><img src="tab_keypad.png" alt="Tab Keypad" /><br/>
Keypad provides easy way to insert assembly instructions in case the syntax of an instruction is not known.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory details</p>

<p><img src="tab_memory.png" alt="Tab Memory" /><br/>
This tab provides easy access to the memory contents. By default only first 1000 locations are shown. To see next locations, enter address in ‘Start’ text box and press ‘OK’ button.</p></li>
<li><p>I/O details</p>

<p><img src="tab_io.png" alt="Tab IO" /><br/>
This tab provides easy access to the I/O contents. User can also manipulate the values by simply editing the cell contents.</p></li>
<li><p>Toolbar</p>

<p><img src="toolbar.png" alt="Toolbar" /><br/>
Toolbar provides quick access to various actions such as open/save/print program, assemble/execute program, debugging actions etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Assembler Listing</p>

<p><img src="assembler_listing.png" alt="Assembler Listing" /><br/>
The assembler listing window (accessed through menu Assembler -> Show listing) provides the hexadecimal opcodes of the program. These opcodes can be used to run the program on actual hardware.</p></li>
</ul>
